# School_District_Analysis
Analysing student funding and students’ standardized test score to uncover trend

## An Analysis of PyCity Schools
The purpose of the document is to analyse data on student funding and students’ standardized test score from Math and reading score by each school to  showcase school performance,  to assist school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding school budget and priorities. 

## PyCity Schools findings:
When the analysis was being conducted it was informed that the grades of the ninth graders at Thomas High School have been changed. To not impact our analyse those grades were substituted for NaN (Not a Number value). This analyses will compare the before and after this change.

All the snapshots below will present the before and after the change in the 9th graders at Thomas High School.

*	This first picture is a  high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, showing the top performance by overall passing percentual. 
*	The total budget of the schools in the district is $24,649,428. This is an important information to  determine how much money should be allocated to and spent on each school; this will also allow the school board to set the budget for the upcoming school year.
*	It is possible to see that the bottom performance schools are the large size ones.
*	In the pic below, it is possible to see that Thomas High School went from top position to 8th position after the change in the 9th graders.

*	The average math and Reading scores by students in each grade level at each school – for the ninth graders the value was replaced by NaN

* School performance based on the budget per student and the school size – Here it is possible to see that the average Math and Reading scores didn’t change but it affected the Math and Reading passing percentages for the group of schools that has the spending range per student between $630 - $644 and the medium size school groups, by decreasing them.

* School performance based on the type of school. Here it is possible to see that the average math and reading scores didn’t change but it affected the  math and reading passing percentages for charter type of school and not district, by decreasing them.

## Recommendation:
Even without the full information about Thomas High School, it is possible to see that largers schools are not having the same performance as the others, and it is recommended that largers school could get more attention from the board, so it could increase their performances.
